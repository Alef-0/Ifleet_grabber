# Ifleet_grabber
Using Selenium to use the IFLEET on the recorder to get the camera images

You will need to use EDGE with internet explorer compatibilities.
For this to might work please see if all the registry keys are correct. using the comments of the code and the print of the documentation.

- The process of sending keys is very slow, so will be sending them copying and pasting from the board.
- Don't save passwords and other things on the code, use a .env file.
